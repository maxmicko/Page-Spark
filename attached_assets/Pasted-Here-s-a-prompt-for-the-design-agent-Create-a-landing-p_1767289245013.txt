Here's a prompt for the design agent:

---

**Create a landing page for a mobile car wash business management app. The design should be clean, professional, and trustworthy—not salesy or manipulative.**

**Core Requirements:**
- Modern, minimalist design with plenty of white space
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Professional color scheme (suggest blues/greens for trust and cleanliness, but open to alternatives)
- Real functionality—working navigation, smooth scrolling, interactive elements

**Page Structure:**

1. **Hero Section**
   - App name/logo placeholder
   - Clear, simple tagline: "Schedule jobs, track routes, manage customers—built for mobile car wash businesses"
   - Clean screenshot/mockup of the actual app interface (you can use a placeholder phone mockup)
   - Single primary CTA button: "Try Free for 14 Days"

2. **Features Section**
   - Grid layout showing 4-6 key features with icons:
     * Customer & vehicle management
     * Smart appointment scheduling
     * Route optimization with maps
     * Service type configuration
     * Business hours management
     * Job tracking & analytics
   - Each feature: icon + headline + 1-2 sentence honest description
   - Optional: Phone mockups showing actual app screens for each feature

3. **How It Works** (Simple 3-step process)
   - Step 1: Add your customers and services
   - Step 2: Schedule appointments and view optimized routes
   - Step 3: Track jobs and manage your day
   - Visual timeline or step indicators

4. **Pricing Section**
   - Clear, upfront pricing display
   - Simple pricing card (suggest: "$29/month" or similar with feature list)
   - "14-day free trial, no credit card required"
   - Clear about what's included

5. **FAQ Section**
   - 5-6 common questions in accordion format:
     * How does route optimization work?
     * What happens to my data?
     * Can I cancel anytime?
     * Is there a setup fee?
     * What devices does it work on?
     * Do you offer support?

6. **Final CTA Section**
   - Simple, clean call-to-action
   - "Ready to get organized?" or similar non-pushy headline
   - CTA button + secondary option (like "Have questions? Contact us")

7. **Footer**
   - Links: Privacy Policy, Terms, Support, Contact
   - Social media icons (optional)
   - Copyright info

**Design Principles:**
- Use real app screenshots or high-quality mockups (not generic stock photos)
- Typography should be clear and readable (modern sans-serif)
- No fake urgency tactics (countdown timers, "only X spots left")
- No aggressive popups or chat widgets
- Smooth, subtle animations on scroll (not distracting)
- Proper contrast for accessibility
- Professional but approachable tone

**Technical:**
- Single-page HTML with smooth scroll navigation
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Fast loading, optimized performance
- Working interactive elements (accordion FAQ, smooth scroll to sections)

**Tone:** Professional, straightforward, helpful—like you're explaining something useful to a colleague, not trying to sell them something.
